# TBI-Smart-App
The design goal of the project was to create a mobile application to provide a general risk for TBI (Tramatic Brain Injury) given metrics developed from MRI and CT image data and real time accelerometer/ gyroscope sensor input. The project was facilitated through Android SDK and Arduino to create a visual representation of the data for our project prototype.
